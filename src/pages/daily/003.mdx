If you wanna win in life you gotta know what game you're playing.

There are many games out there:

-   professional athlete
-   secure job > buy a house > save money (low-risk / low-reward)
-   credentials: stanford > google > ex-google backed by YC, Sequoia, a16z > Forbes 30 Under 30 > blue checkmark on Twitter
-   solo founder bootstrapping a lifestyle business

and many more.

But be careful. If you don't pick the game, society will pick it for you. And you'll feel miserable.

Why? Because you haven't chosen the rules. They will suck. It won't feel like a game.

For the past few months I did feel miserable. I was playing the credentials game even though I didn&apos;t want to. I was being deceived by the system. I was picking projects based on how cool they'd look in my resume. A resume that I don&apos;t even intend to use...

But sometimes we are so pilled by the system that it's hard to pick the right game.

I&apos;ve been drinking the startup kool-aid for the past 2-3 years. I watched every YouTube videos out there, read all the books. And yet I&apos;d never even considered the possibility of entrepreneurship. It wasn&apos;t in my book.

But I tried other games and they just don&apos;t make sense to me:

-   credentials: I dabbled with it, and now I see how bullshit they are
-   VC-backed startups: this is a large group, but I definitely don&apos;t want to play the vanity / status game
-   Fat FIRE: I don&apos;t really care about money, a couple grands a month is more than enough to me. But I do care about the craft.

Now it&apos;s all about defining the rules. Or in other words, my personal values. Julian Shapiro has [a great essay on that topic](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning).

Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve figured out so far:

-   I don&apos;t want to do something for money, but I want financial freedom
-   I want to build the technologies of the future
-   I want to build a strong founder-led company, deeply passionate about their customers, like Nathan Bary and Tobi Lutke

But I&apos;ll be honest with you. All of that is a bit too abstract at the moment and I&apos;m not really sure where I go from there...

These past days you couldn't get yourself out of bed. You felt empty. No motivation, no joy. You felt like you had no goals, no drive, no purpose.

In contrast, you see everyone on Instagram, Twitter and YouTube having so much fun, success and impact.

You get jealous. You want change. You take resolutions.

But you can't stick to them. Everytime you start something new, you get a little spike of motivation. But it fades away just as fast. You get caught up in self-doubt and overthinking.

You might have a severe case of _dopamine addiction_. I certainly have.

Did you know that if you get dopamine hits too regularly you become numb to it?

Don't quote me on that, but basically what happens is that if you get too many hits - notifications, watching a new video of your favorite YouTuber - your dopamine increases and then goes back down.
But if these spikes are too close, your normal dopamine level stays high and now nothing gets you excited anymore, because the level doesn't matter, the increase ratio does. The lower your normal level is, the easier it is to get motivated.

But it gets worse!

At this point, it's not the reward that causes the dopamine spike. It's the anticipation of it.

You announce that you are going to start a YouTube channel, boom, get that shot. But then that's it. No more motivation. You already got your dose...

So what's the remedy?

A _detox_!

Cut out all the sources of "cheap dopamine". Remove Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Tiktok from your phone. Install a site blocker extension on your laptop. Stop listening to audio books every time you do something (cleaning, washing dishes, walking, working out).
It sucks for the first couple of days but you'll feel amazing by the end of the week.

I've actually never sticked to it for an entire week and I'm not sure how long it should last.

But I want to take this opportunity - a week and a half left of Ramadhan - to follow this strict diet: zero YouTube and Twitter.

Let's see how it goes!

I have the privilege of being my own boss. I took 6 months off of college to do my own thing.

But I made a huge mistake. My plan was just that... doing my own _thing_.

Let me unroll how it went for you (2 months in).

I started off super excited. A bunch of ideas and endless motivation. At least that's what I thought...

I wanted that freedom for the longest time and now I was finally able to work on my _side_ projects full time.

And with that freedom ultimately came the breaking point: the **idea**.

See, I'm an idea person. I have a ton of ideas. At least 10 a day. And I write down all of them.

But now I'm free, so I don't have to _just_ write them down. I get to dig into it.

1, 2, 3 days went into researching and working on new ideas that just popped up. A little bit of market research here. A little bit of designing mockups there. And even prototyping sometimes.

By the end of the first month, here I was with 5 open loops. I can't even call them projects. Not even _side_ projects. Just open loops.

I don't know what the heck I'm supposed to do with that. I haven't worked on the first project for weeks. The second idea is actually not that good. The third idea doesn't have any machine learning in it so it's a pass.

Oh, but it's too late. Sorry. Now you've given these ideas enough space to poke your mind every now and then. Even though you're not _that_ interested, the reason you got them in the first place is still valid. So you keep thinking about all of them. Constantly.

I'm overwhelmed. Lost. What was the point of all of this again? Oh yes, doing my own _thing_. Well I guess I am doing it...

I believe you need constraints even when your working for yourself.

You need to commit to something. You need to have a plan for the moments of doubt and difficulty. Because believe me, it will punch you in the face sooner than you think.

But I was naive. I explicitly avoided commiting to a strict plan.

Total freedom assumes you're always going to be in control, strong and disciplined. It never happens.

Real freedom is having a prison of your own making.

I&apos;ve been working a lot on listening to myself and doing self-therapy / trying to show empathy for myself by trying to understand my feelings and why do I feel that way

But I feel like I&apos;ve reached a level of diminishing return. I became a little bitch. Lol.

Of course some things are going to feel uncomfortable or even wrong. But you can&apos;t stop just because a little voice in your head told you to.

Sometimes you just have to tell it shut up and keep pushing.

I&apos;ve been too kind with that inner voice lately. I got to be a bit more brutal with myself. Let&apos;s get uncomfortable shall we?

export default ({ children }) => (
    <PostLayout
        title={title}
        publishedAt={publishedAt}
        toc={toc}
        children={children}
    />
)
